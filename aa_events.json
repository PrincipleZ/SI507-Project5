Should I still get my sensor cleaned?\n No. Even if your camera exterior is dirty, if there are no spots in your photos, there's no reason to get your sensor cleaned. Performing external cleaning of the camera or cleaning the mirror cage cavity can actually push dust onto your sensor, so if it's not broken, don't to try to fix it! ;) \n What is sensor cleaning?\n A certified repairman will use a combination of a sensor scope, a sensor vacuum, a hurricane blower, and sensor swabs to remove any dust or other foreign material that has settled on your sensor.  \n Why is it recommended a certified repairman performs the sensor cleaning? \nBecause the sensor is highly sensitive and easily scratched, we recommend leaving sensor cleaning to the professionals.  \n How much does it normally cost to have a sensor cleaned?\n Midwest Camera Repair, located in Wyandotte, MI typically charges $65 to perform sensor cleanings.\u00a0  This $30 sensor cleaning special we're offering runs one day only (Saturday, November 11th) and is a phenomenal deal!

Any realistic examination of U.S. history clearly shows that democracy has never been more than a guiding principle.\nEven so, although our democratic ideals have been severely compromised, they\u2019ve provided a strong and compelling goal toward which many Americans have aspired.\nToday, this has changed. Over the past 50 years or so, huge numbers of Americans have lost faith in the idea of a citizen-driven, responsible, reliable democratic government. Whether on the local, state, or federal level, many Americans believe themselves to exist in an adversarial relationship with their legislators, and with the entire political process.\nBut isn\u2019t our government supposed to be us? Has democracy itself failed, or are our democratic ideals losing credibility in the face of other corrupting social forces? If other forces are at fault, then what exactly are they?

Keith Center for Civil Rights. The Keith Center is dedicated to promoting the educational, economic and political empowerment of under-represented communities in urban areas and to ensuring that the phrase \"equal justice under law\" applies to all members of society. Professor Hammer was instrumental in editing and compiling Judge Damon J. Keith's new biography,\u00a0Crusader for Justice: Federal Judge Damon J. Keith (2013). Professor Hammer has become a leading voice on the economic and social issues impacting the city of Detroit, and has added new courses to the law school curriculum on \"Race, Law and Social Change in Southeast Michigan\" and \"Re-Imagining Development in Detroit: Institutions, Law & Society.\"\n\u00a0America was established on the back of lofty democratic ideals. But has America ever really lived out its creed \u2013 even by its own standards?

He has explored the ways in which political campaigns can frame information about racial issues in order to activate and make politically relevant voter attitudes about particular racial groups. Current work focuses on inter-racial and inter-ethnic competition and the ways in which elite communications can exacerbate or diminish inter-group conflict.\u00a0He is currently the co-Principal Investigator of the American National Election Study (ANES).\u00a0\u00a0Professor Hutchings authored\u00a0Public Opinion and Democratic Accountability (2003).

What have been the most notable democratic victories and set-backs in that time? Why has there been a massive national turn toward the acceptance of right-wing authoritarianism, and what threat does this pose to the ideals that historically have underscored our aspirational democratic center? This session will focus primarily on the right-wing backlash of the past 50 years or so, especially that which has taken place in the wake of the Civil Rights movement. It will describe the development of the general lack of faith Americans feel about the efficacy of citizenship, reflect upon the connections between the ways the widespread political and social manipulation of race and class acted to thwart democratic practice in the past, and show how that same manipulation currently is being used to erode our national faith in our democratic principles. It will illuminate how/why in recent years we\u2019ve had a government that ignores/contradicts/flouts established guiding democratic principles, and point out the danger this poses.\u00a0\n\nClosing\n\u00a04:45 PM to 5:10 PM \nLa\u2019Ron Williams, B.F.A., Professional Storyteller and\u00a0Racial Justice Educator\n\u00a0Biography: (See his bio. listed above for his Welcome and Introduction talk)\nWhat can we do to rescue democracy? In this session, Washtenaw Faces Race will offer suggestions for steps that can be taken to address the current challenges to America\u2019s democratic ideals. We will allow time for attendees to make connections with area groups who are already involved in actions to maintain democracy. \nAt the same time, we will advocate for an additional step: We assert that what passes for democracy under the current status quo in this country is neither benign nor neutral. In fact, we assert that in practice, we remain so far from our democratic values that we cannot even accurately be called a democracy. We raise the question: How does one \"protect\" or \"defend\" something that has never really existed? Instead, we believe that we must, in full awareness of our historic choices and the effects they have had on our social set-up, consciously make the decision to rescue our democratic ideals, to declare them to be our shared national goal, to advocate for their realization, and to work together to make it so.\u00a0We believe it's time for a new, organized campaign based on a collective citizen demand to become in reality the land of freedom and justice that we claim we\u2019ve always been.\u00a0", "html": "<H2>RESCUING DEMOCRACY:\u00a0 A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION</H2>\n<H2 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">SATURDAY NOVEMBER 11, 2017 FROM 1:00 pm \u2013 5:10 pm</H2>\n<H2 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Washtenaw Community College,\u00a0Crain Liberal Arts Building, Room 275</H2>\n<H2 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>4800 East Huron River Drive,\u00a0</SPAN>Ann Arbor, MI\u00a0</H2>\n<H3>Note: Scroll down past the map for the Conference Program details:\u00a0 titles of talks and speaker biographies</H3>\n<HR>\n<P><STRONG>DIRECTIONS &amp; MAP - (free parking)\u00a0</STRONG></P>\n<HR>\n<P>Enter off Huron River Drive east of Dixboro Road and proceed past free surface parking lots 1-3, to free parking in structure (labelled \"PSD\" on map below).\u00a0 Enter Crain Liberal Arts building (labelled \"LA\" on map below) from 2nd floor of parking structure through connector.\u00a0 Proceed to Room 275 in the Liberal Arts Building.</P>\n<DIV CLASS=\"clear full photos\"><IMG ALT=\"campus map\" SRC=\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wccnet.edu%2Fglobal%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2Fmaps%2Fcampus.png&sig=ADR2i79-rQFRhcHhbi3cxMFwcdZkXamHOg\"></DIV>\n<HR>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H3><STRONG>WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION</STRONG></H3>\n<H3>1 PM \u2013 1:25 PM</H3>\n<H4 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>La\u2019Ron Williams, B.F.A., Professional Storyteller and\u00a0</STRONG><STRONG>Racial Justice Educator</STRONG></H4>\n<HR>\n<H3><STRONG>THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES, 1787-1877\u00a0</STRONG></H3>\n<H3 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>1:25 PM \u2013 2:25 PM</STRONG></H3>\n<H4 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><STRONG>Howard Brick, Ph.D., Louis Evans Professor of History, University of\u00a0</STRONG><STRONG>Michigan</STRONG></H4>\n<HR>\n<H2 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">BREAK</H2>\n<H2>2:25 PM - 2:35 PM</H2>\n<HR>\n<P><STRONG>DEMOCRACY AND THE AMERICAN REALITY\u00a0</STRONG></P>\n<H3>2:35 PM \u2013 3:35 PM</H3>\n<H4 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\">Peter Hammer, J.D., Ph.D., Director of Damon J.

This session will focus primarily on the right-wing backlash of the past 50 years or so, especially that which has taken place in the wake of the Civil Rights movement. It will describe the development of the general lack of faith Americans feel about the efficacy of citizenship, reflect upon the connections between the ways the widespread political and social manipulation of race and class acted to thwart democratic practice in the past, and show how that same manipulation currently is being used to erode our national faith in our democratic <I>principles</I>. It will illuminate how/why in recent years we\u2019ve had a government that ignores/contradicts/flouts established guiding democratic principles, and point out the danger this poses.\u00a0</H3>\n<HR>\n<H3>Closing</H3>\n<H4 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a04:45 PM to 5:10 PM </SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></H4>\n<H4 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>La\u2019Ron Williams, B.F.A., Professional Storyteller and\u00a0</SPAN>Racial Justice Educator</H4>\n<H4 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0Biography: (See his bio. listed above for his Welcome and Introduction talk)</SPAN></H4>\n<H3 CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>What can we do to rescue democracy?
