Rather than reaching for the stars, how about we start with expectations. CEOs, Executive Directors, Boards of Directors, all have ideas of what the Development Department and/or fundraiser is supposed to be doing. Do you know what they want? Is it even realistic? Does change need to happen? Join us for a look at what some top leaders had to say and learn how it impacts you, your career and your organization. The session will end with a discussion on how to educate employers on the role fundraising should play in their organization, how to manage expectations, and how to communicate to employers what it is that fundraisers need to carry out their jobs effectively.\nRegistration includes a boxed lunch. The webinar will begin promptly at noon.\n\nWho Should Attend? \nDevelopment and Fundraising staff, Nonprofit Executive Directors, and Board Members. \n\u00a0\nLearning Objectives:\n\u2022 Understand what nonprofit leaders and decision-makers think about the fundraising profession and\n\u00a0\u00a0 the role of development departments in their organizations\n\u2022 Learning the key skills and attributes decision-makers are looking for when making hiring decisions and\n\u00a0\u00a0 what they want fundraisers to accomplish once they are hired\n\u2022 Discovering what nonprofit CEOs think about fundraiser turnover and what they are doing to address it\n\u00a0\u00a0 in their organizations\n\u2022 Learning how to educate nonprofit employers so that their expectations align with the realities of the\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 fundraising profession\n\u2022 Learning how to market fundraising within the organization\n\u00a0\nAbout the Speaker: \nNancy Racette, CFRE, Principal and Chief Operating Officer, Development Resources, inc.\nNancy is the founding partner and Chief Operating Officer of Development Resources, inc.

Rather than reaching for the stars, how about we start with expectations. CEOs, Executive Directors, Boards of Directors, all have ideas of what the Development Department and/or fundraiser is supposed to be doing. Do you know what they want? Is it even realistic? Does change need to happen? Join us for a look at what some top leaders had to say and learn how it impacts you, your career and your organization. The session will end with a discussion on how to educate employers on the role fundraising should play in their organization, how to manage expectations, and how to communicate to employers what it is that fundraisers need to carry out their jobs effectively.</P>\n<P CLASS=\"normal\"><SPAN>Registration includes a boxed lunch.

Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan, and is at the very heart of Japan House. Learn the history behind this art, and enjoy a bowl of matcha tea and a traditional sweet. Experience a moment of peace.\u00a0\r\nReservations are required. You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you, and you still still be at the same height as the other participants.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFAQs\r\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\r\nThere are metered parking spaces in the lot to the north of us (at St. Mary's Road and Lincoln) and to the south of us (on Lincoln across from the Vet Med complex). On weekends the south lot is free.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIs my registration/ticket transferrable?\r\nYes, if space allows, you may transfer your registration to a different event.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\r\nYou do not have to bring your ticket. We will just need your name.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?\r\nThe purchaser of the ticket can go to \"My Tickets\" and change the name to whomever will be attending.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat if I want to purchase more than 10 tickets or schedule a special group?\r\nWe are happy to work with you to schedule a group. Just call us at (217) 244-9934. We can also talk about scheduling a tea ceremony at a special time for you, depending on availability.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is the refund policy?\r\nYou registration is refundable if you contact us (217-244-9934) 24 hours before the date of your reservation.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\r\nThe tea ceremony is for all ages. Children are welcome as long as they are able to sit quietly throughout the ceremony. Admission is required for all regardless of whether they partake in the tea and sweet.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhere can I contact the organizer with any questions?\r\nContact us with any questions at (217) 244-9934 or japanhouse@illinois.edu\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0", "html": "<P>Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony.
