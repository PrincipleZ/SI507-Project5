We spend New Years in Miami, last year and it was the worst experience of my life. This year we decided to stay home and go to your party and had a great time. Great music, plenty of bars, great food, and a great crowd.\nBrian H,Lincoln Park, IL\nI never send thank you letters but I just wanted to say thanks from my group of friends from University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Illinois in Champaign, We felt like we knew half the people at the event. It was the first time we had gone to a nice hotel party and was very happy with the choice. Everything went very smoothly from Check-in and the bathrooms to the bar service and the DJ's. We loved all the different rooms with DJ's playing a different type of music in each. BTW we thought the VIP tickets were well worth the money. I'm sure we will bring a bigger group next year.\nDavid H.Highland Park IL\nI had heard great things about the Chicago Scene NYE Party at The Drake Hotel but this was our first time at the party and it was a blast! We stayed at the hotel for three nights and made a great little vacation out of it. A few of our friend that we went to college with at University of Michigan that live in Chicago invited us to the party and we are very happy we made the trip in. We look forward to coming back to Chicago for New years in the next few years.\nLeslie J.Bloomfield Hills, MI\nGreat Party! I went to school at University of Indian and a bunch of guys from my Frat House made the party sort of a 5 year post graduation reunion. I now live in San Francisco so making the trip back to the cold was not something I was looking forward to. It turned out to be one of the Best New Years Parties I've ever been to.\nMiklos RSan Francisco, CA\nFAQ\n\nYes, the New Years Eve 2018\u00a0party will sell out.\nYes, the ticket price increases as the party sells out.\nYes, People buy & sell tickets on Craiglist.org before and after the party sells out.\nWhy is our ticket price higher than most of the other Venue Prices? The Drake Hotel is the nicest NYE Party Venue in Chicago and that makes it a very expensive place to have an event. Ask anyone that has had a Wedding there.\nIf you think you are going to be in Chicago for New Years and you are reading this then buy tickets now and sell them later if you can't go.\n3rd Party Tickets: If you'd like to sell your tickets to a 3rd Party, just give them the ticket or the PDF for them to print out.\nTickets will not be mailed to you, You must print out your own tickets or show them on your phone at the entrance, bring a Valid ID and credit card if you have any issues.\nCheck in the night of the event beginning at Noon in the Lobby then at 7PM on the street level of the hotel. You will then be given a wristband to enter the party.\nYes we have several coat check areas.\nValet parking is available. Call 312-787-2200 for rates.\nThe Drake Hotel Sells Out so get your room/Party Packages early.\nOne of the best reasons to come to our party at the Drake Hotel is getting home, we have plenty of taxi's, buses, trains and hotels rooms in the area. You don't have to worry about getting stuck out in the cold in the middle of nowhere at 3AM freezing your tush off.\nGroup Ticket sales Discounts for Groups of 6 or more Call 312-587-3474 Ext. 2\u00a0\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\n\n\nDress Code: Cocktail to Tux, (Men: Suits, Sport Coat & Slacks, Tuxedo ) Take a Look at the\u00a0Drake NYE Party Photos\u00a0for a good idea (No Jeans, T-Shirts, Hats or Gym Shoes)\nMust be at least 21 to enter with valid ID\nLegal Notice: Drug use or unruly behavior will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to fullest extent of the law.\nTickets are non-refundable.\nParty arrangements are based on projected attendance and are subject to change.\n\n\n\u00a0_\n\u00a0Other ChicagoScene.com events:\n\n*ALL SALES FINAL | NO REFUNDS*\nFor More info go to: ChicagoScene.com", "html": "<P><STRONG><IMG ALT=\"New Years Eve Party Chicago The Drake Hotel\" SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/21218956/newyearsevepartychicagodrakehotel2018a.jpg\"></STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>New Year's Eve <STRONG>Party\u00a0</STRONG>2018 at The Drake Hotel - <STRONG>18TH Annual Event -</STRONG>\u00a0<STRONG>Chicago's Longest Running NYE Party!<BR></STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Nothing to Think about.

We spend New Years in Miami, last year and it was the worst experience of my life. This year we decided to stay home and go to your party and had a great time. Great music, plenty of bars, great food, and a great crowd.</P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><SPAN>Brian H,<BR>Lincoln Park, IL</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<P>I never send thank you letters but I just wanted to say thanks from my group of friends from University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Illinois in Champaign, We felt like we knew half the people at the event. It was the first time we had gone to a nice hotel party and was very happy with the choice. Everything went very smoothly from Check-in and the bathrooms to the bar service and the DJ's. We loved all the different rooms with DJ's playing a different type of music in each. BTW we thought the VIP tickets were well worth the money. I'm sure we will bring a bigger group next year.</P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><SPAN>David H.<BR>Highland Park IL</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<P>I had heard great things about the Chicago Scene NYE Party at The Drake Hotel but this was our first time at the party and it was a blast! We stayed at the hotel for three nights and made a great little vacation out of it. A few of our friend that we went to college with at University of Michigan that live in Chicago invited us to the party and we are very happy we made the trip in. We look forward to coming back to Chicago for New years in the next few years.</P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><SPAN>Leslie J.<BR>Bloomfield Hills, MI</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<P>Great Party! I went to school at University of Indian and a bunch of guys from my Frat House made the party sort of a 5 year post graduation reunion. I now live in San Francisco so making the trip back to the cold was not something I was looking forward to. It turned out to be one of the Best New Years Parties I've ever been to.</P>\n<P><STRONG><SPAN><SPAN>Miklos R<BR>San Francisco, CA</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P>\n<H2>FAQ</H2>\n<UL>\n<LI>Yes, the <SPAN>New Years Eve 2018\u00a0</SPAN>party will sell out.</LI>\n<LI>Yes, the ticket price increases as the party sells out.</LI>\n<LI>Yes, People buy &amp; sell tickets on Craiglist.org before and after the party sells out.</LI>\n<LI>Why is our ticket price higher than most of the other Venue Prices? The Drake Hotel is the nicest NYE Party Venue in Chicago and that makes it a very expensive place to have an event. Ask anyone that has had a Wedding there.</LI>\n<LI>If you think you are going to be in Chicago for New Years and you are reading this then buy tickets now and sell them later if you can't go.</LI>\n<LI>3rd Party Tickets: If you'd like to sell your tickets to a 3rd Party, just give them the ticket or the PDF for them to print out.</LI>\n<LI>Tickets will not be mailed to you, You must print out your own tickets or show them on your phone at the entrance, bring a Valid ID and credit card if you have any issues.</LI>\n<LI>Check in the night of the event beginning at Noon in the Lobby then at 7PM on the street level of the hotel. You will then be given a wristband to enter the party.</LI>\n<LI>Yes we have several coat check areas.</LI>\n<LI>Valet parking is available. Call 312-787-2200 for rates.</LI>\n<LI>The Drake Hotel Sells Out so get your room/Party Packages early.</LI>\n<LI>One of the best reasons to come to our party at the Drake Hotel is getting home, we have plenty of taxi's, buses, trains and hotels rooms in the area. You don't have to worry about getting stuck out in the cold in the middle of nowhere at 3AM freezing your tush off.</LI>\n<LI>Group Ticket sales Discounts for Groups of 6 or more Call 312-587-3474 Ext. 2\u00a0</LI>\n</UL>\n<H2>ADDITIONAL INFO</H2>\n<UL>\n<UL>\n<LI>Dress Code: Cocktail to Tux, (Men: Suits, Sport Coat &amp; Slacks, Tuxedo ) Take a Look at the\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://www.chicago-scene.com/new-years-eve-chicago.htm#Photos\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Drake NYE Party Photos</A>\u00a0for a good idea (No Jeans, T-Shirts, Hats or Gym Shoes)</LI>\n<LI>Must be at least 21 to enter with valid ID</LI>\n<LI>Legal Notice: Drug use or unruly behavior will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to fullest extent of the law.</LI>\n<LI>Tickets are non-refundable.</LI>\n<LI><SPAN>Party arrangements are based on projected attendance and are subject to change.</SPAN></LI>\n</UL>\n</UL>\n<P>\u00a0<IMG ALT=\"Chicago Scene 2017 New Years Eve at the Drake\" SRC=\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchicago-scene.com%2FNew-Years-Eve-Drake-Hotel-Chicago-Banner-GMA-768-b.jpg&sig=ADR2i7-bxURF1Tgxk1mSYAt6BSN1b2pFVg\"><SPAN>_</SPAN></P>\n<P>\u00a0Other <A HREF=\"http://chicagoscene.com/scene-events/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" TITLE=\"Scene Events\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">ChicagoScene.com events:</A></P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.chicagosceneboatparty.com\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><IMG ALT=\"Chicago Scene Boat Party\" SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/21218956/chicagosceneboatpartynodateproducersof.jpg\"></IMG></A></P>\n<P>*ALL SALES FINAL | NO REFUNDS*</P>\n<P><SPAN>For More info go to: <A HREF=\"http://www.ChicagoScene.com\" TARGET=\"_blank\" TITLE=\"ChicagoScene.com\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">ChicagoScene.com</A></SPAN></P>"}, "id": "34962290151", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/new-years-eve-party-the-drake-hotel-2018-chicago-scene-tickets-34962290151?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2017-12-31T21:00:00", "utc": "2018-01-01T03:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2018-01-01T02:00:00", "utc": "2018-01-01T08:00:00Z"}, "created": "2017-05-30T02:36:04Z", "changed": "2017-11-09T05:15:15Z", "capacity": 2667, "capacity_is_custom": true, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": false, "locale": "en", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "is_reserved_seating": false, "source": "create_2.0", "is_free": false, "version": "3.0.0", "logo_id": "31873364", "organizer_id": "1539938638", "venue_id": "1332978", "category_id": "110", "subcategory_id": null, "format_id": "11", "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/34962290151/", "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 25}, "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F31873364%2F21367488692%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?s=4a119ae5f10ab947ff41a3c0ae532420", "width": null, "height": null}, "id": "31873364", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F31873364%2F21367488692%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?h=200&w=450&rect=0%2C25%2C1200%2C600&s=0b03d5abf273ccc2bf26b4eb323dfc03", "aspect_ratio": "2", "edge_color": null, "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Paul Farmer, MD: \"The Ebola Suspect's Dilemma\"", "html": "Paul Farmer, MD: &#34;The Ebola Suspect&#39;s Dilemma&#34;"}, "description": {"text": "The 29th\u00a0Annual Dorothy J.

We offer vibrant, year-round markets\u00a0paired with engaging at-market programs including chef demos, youth activities, Link matching, and\u00a0compost. GCM runs a Produce Box in Bronzeville where we sell local fruits and veggies on a weekly\u00a0basis throughout the summer. GCM also works with local schools to provide hands-on cooking and\u00a0gardening education.GCM was founded in 1998 by Abby Mandel, a notable Chicago food writer who wanted to increase\u00a0the availability of local, sustainably grown food. What started as a small startup with six farmers in an\u00a0alley next to the Chicago Theater has since grown to include over 50 third-party certified vendors\u00a0along with education and access programs that further create community around food.\nOUR SPONSORS:\nHOSTED BY\u00a0Lakeshore Beverage\u00a0\n\n\nDIGITAL SPONSORS:\u00a0BND Interiors,\u00a0Goose Island,\u00a0DAVIDsTEA,\u00a0Interactive Health\u00a0&\u00a0Getaround\n\n\n\n\nIN-KIND: Candid Wines,\u00a0Edible Chicago,\u00a0Green Sheep Water\u00a0&\u00a0Renew Packaging\n\n\n\n\nMedia Sponsor: WBEZ 91.5\n\n\nSpecial thanks to our Host Committee:\nBryan Blaise, Sarah Cole Kammerer, Mike Coutre, Alyssa Erickson, Adam Garber, Noemi Garcia, Steven Genco, Melissa Hahn, Natalie Hilvert, Ali Lenti , Kim McShea, Mary Mullen, Dan Nudleman, Linda Ozag, Audrey Peiper, Anthony V.

GCM also works with local schools to provide hands-on cooking and\u00a0gardening education.<BR>GCM was founded in 1998 by Abby Mandel, a notable Chicago food writer who wanted to increase\u00a0the availability of local, sustainably grown food. What started as a small startup with six farmers in an\u00a0alley next to the Chicago Theater has since grown to include over 50 third-party certified vendors\u00a0along with education and access programs that further create community around food.<BR><BR></P>\n<H2>OUR SPONSORS:</H2>\n<H3>HOSTED BY\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.handfamilycompanies.com/lakeshore-beverage\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Lakeshore Beverage</A>\u00a0</H3>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/logolakeshore.png\"></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H3>DIGITAL SPONSORS:\u00a0<A HREF=\"bndinteriors.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">BND Interiors</A>,\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://www.gooseisland.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Goose Island</A>,\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.davidstea.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">DAVIDsTEA</A>,\u00a0<A HREF=\"interactivehealthinc.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Interactive Health</A>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.getaround.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Getaround</A></H3>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/bndlogo.png\"><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/goose4cwhitetypecopy.jpg\"><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/getaroundlogo28129.png\"></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H3>IN-KIND: <A HREF=\"http://www.candidwines.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Candid Wines</A>,\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://ediblechicago.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Edible Chicago</A>,\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.greensheepwater.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Green Sheep Water</A>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://renewbag.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Renew Packaging</A></H3>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/candidlogonoborder.png\"></P>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/edifble.png\"></P>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/greensheep.png\"></P>\n<P><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/renewpackaginglogo.jpeg\"></P>\n<P><STRONG>Media Sponsor:</STRONG> <A HREF=\"https://www.wbez.org/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">WBEZ 91.5</A></P>\n<DIV CLASS=\"call-c\"><IMG SRC=\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=..%2F..%2Fcmsimages%2Fwbez_pogo.png%2Fimage-full%3Bsize%24350%2C86.ImageHandler&sig=ADR2i790qNz5Pu1B9hD0ZfqW0wjcl9k7cQ\"></DIV>\n<DIV CLASS=\"call-c\"><A HREF=\"https://www.wbez.org/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/22765416/wbezpogo.png\"></IMG></A></DIV>\n<P CLASS=\"call-c\"><STRONG>Special thanks to our Host Committee:</STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"call-c\"><SPAN>Bryan Blaise, Sarah Cole Kammerer, Mike Coutre, Alyssa Erickson, Adam Garber, Noemi Garcia, Steven Genco, Melissa Hahn, Natalie Hilvert, Ali Lenti , Kim McShea, Mary Mullen, Dan Nudleman, Linda Ozag, Audrey Peiper, Anthony V.

Mardi Gras Madness Tour @ Thalia Hall"}, "description": {"text": "Recording both as\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0Funkadelic,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0revolutionized R&B during the \u201970s, twisting soul music into funk by adding influences from several late-\u201960s acid heroes:\u00a0Jimi Hendrix,\u00a0Frank Zappa, and\u00a0Sly Stone. The\u00a0Parliament/Funkadelicmachine ruled black music during the \u201970s, capturing over 40 R&B hit singles (including three number ones) and recording three platinum albums.Born in Kannapolis, NC, on July 22, 1941,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0became interested in doo wop while living in New Jersey during the early \u201950s. . Basing his group on\u00a0Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, Clinton formed\u00a0The Parliaments\u00a0in 1955, rehearsing in the back room of a Plainfield barbershop where he straightened hair.\u00a0The Parliaments\u00a0released only two singles during the next ten years, but frequent trips to Detroit during the mid-\u201960s \u2013 where Clinton began working as a songwriter and producer \u2013 eventually paid off their investment.The Parliaments\u00a0finally had a hit with the 1967 single \u201c(I Wanna) Testify\u201d for the Detroit-based\u00a0Revilot Records, but the label ran into trouble and Clinton refused to record any new material. Instead of waiting for a settlement, Clinton decided to record the same band under a new name:\u00a0Funkadelic. Founded in 1968, the group began life as a smoke screen, claiming as its only members the Parliaments\u2019 backing but in truth including Clinton and the rest of the former Parliaments lineup. Revilot folded not long after, with the label\u2019s existing contracts sold to\u00a0Atlantic; Clinton, however, decided to abandon the Parliaments name rather than record for the major label.By 1970,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0had regained the rights to\u00a0The Parliaments\u00a0name: he then signed the entire\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0lineup to\u00a0Invictus Records\u00a0as\u00a0Parliament. The group released one album \u2013 1970\u2019s Osmium \u2013 and scored a number 30 hit, \u201cThe Breakdown,\u201d on the R&B charts in 1971. With\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0firing on all cylinders, however, Clinton decided to discontinue\u00a0Parliament\u00a0(the name, not the band) for the time being.Inspired by\u00a0Motown\u2018s assembly line of sound,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0gradually put together a collective of over 50 musicians and recorded the ensemble during the \u201970s both as\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0Funkadelic. While\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0pursued band-format psychedelic rock,\u00a0Parliament\u00a0engaged in a funk free-for-all, blending influences from the godfathers (James Brown\u00a0and\u00a0Sly Stone) with freaky costumes and themes inspired by \u201960s acid culture and science fiction. From its 1970 inception until Clinton\u2019s dissolving of\u00a0Parliament\u00a0in 1980, Clinton hit the R&B Top Ten several times but truly excelled in two other areas: large-selling, effective album statements and the most dazzling, extravagant live show in the business. In an era when Philly soul continued the slick sounds of establishment-approved R&B,\u00a0Parliament / Funkadelic\u00a0scared off more white listeners than it courted. (Ironically, today Clinton\u2019s audiences are a cross-cultural mix of music lovers from 8 to 80.)1978-79 was the most successful year in\u00a0Parliament/Funkadelic\u00a0history:\u00a0Parliament\u00a0hit the charts first with \u201cFlash Light,\u201d P-Funk\u2019s first R&B number one. \u201cAqua Boogie\u201d would hit number one as well late in the year, but\u00a0Funkadelic\u2018s title track to \u201cOne Nation Under a Groove\u201d spent six weeks at the top spot on the R&B charts during the summer. The album, which reflected a growing consistency in styles between\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0Funkadelic, became the first\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0LP to reach platinum (the same year that\u00a0Parliament\u2018s \u201cFunkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome\u201d did the same). In 1979,\u00a0Funkadelic\u2018s \u201c(Not Just) Knee Deep\u201d hit number one as well, and its album (\u201cUncle Jam Wants You\u201d) also reached platinum status.During 1980, Clinton began to be weighed down by legal difficulties arising from\u00a0Polygram\u2018s acquisition of\u00a0Parliament\u2018s label,\u00a0Casablanca. Jettisoning both the\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0names (but not the musicians), Clinton began his solo career with 1982\u2019s \u201cComputer Games\u201d. Several months later, Clinton\u2019s \u201cAtomic Dog\u201d hit number one on the R&B charts; it stayed at the top spot for four weeks, but only managed number 101 on the pop charts. Clinton stayed on\u00a0Capitol\u00a0for three more years, releasing three studio albums and frequently charting singles in the R&B Top 40.Clinton\u00a0and many former\u00a0Parliament/Funkadelic\u00a0members continued to tour and record throughout the \u201980s as the\u00a0P-Funk All Stars, but the decade\u2019s disdain of everything to do with the \u201970s \u2013 especially the sound of disco \u2013 resulted in critical and commercial neglect for the world\u2019s biggest funk band, one which in part had spawned dance music..During much of the three-year period from 1986 to 1989, Clinton became embroiled in legal difficulties (resulting from the myriad royalty problems latent during the \u201970s with recordings of over 40 musicians for four labels under three names). Also problematic during the latter half of the \u201980s was Clinton\u2019s disintegrating reputation as a true forefather of rock; by the end of the decade, however, a generation of rappers reared on P-Funk were beginning to name check him.The early \u201990s saw the rise of funk-inspired rap (courtesy of\u00a0Digital Underground,\u00a0Dr. Dre, and\u00a0Warren G.) and funk rock (Primusand\u00a0Red Hot Chili Peppers) that re-established the status of\u00a0Clinton\u00a0& co. as one of the most important forces in the recent history of black music. Clinton\u2019s music became the soundtrack for the rap movement, as artists from\u00a0MC Hammer, to\u00a0LL Cool J\u00a0to\u00a0Snoop Doggy Dogg\u00a0depended heavily on the infectious groove of\u00a0Clinton\u00a0productions as the foundation of their recordings.Along with the renewed notoriety and respect, Clinton\u2019s visibility and presence became familiar to a wider audience thanks to appearances in movies \u201cThe Night Before\u201d, \u201cHouse Party\u201d, \u201cPCU\u201d, and \u201cGood Burger\u201d, hosting the HBO original series \u201cCosmic Slop\u201d, and doing commercials for Apple computers, Nike, and Rio Mp3 players. Clinton also composed the theme songs for popular TV programs \u201cThe Tracey Ulman Show\u201d and \u201cThe PJs\u201d.Clinton has received a Grammy, a Dove (gospel) , and an MTV music video awards, and has been recognized by BMI, the NAACP Image Awards, and Motown Alumni Association for lifetime achievement. Clinton\u2019s\u00a0Partliament/Funkadelic\u00a0was inducted into the\u00a0Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u00a0in 1997.In reviewing Clinton\u2019s illustrious career and success as a producer / writer/ performer, perhaps his greatest achievement stemmed from his relentless dedication to funk as a musical form. Funk as a musical style had been around for what seems like forever, deeply rooted in the music traditions of New Orleans and the Blues of the Deep South. Following the lead \u2013 and commercial success \u2013 of James Brown and Sly Stone, Clinton took Funk to new heights, blending elements of Jazz, Rock, Pop, Classical and even Gospel into his productions, eventually developing a unique and easily identifiable style affectionately called \u201cPfunk.\u201d Clinton\u2019s inspiration, dedication and determination resulted in the elevation of \u201cfunk\u201d music to complete recognition and acceptance as a true genre in and of itself.On February 16th, 2012\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0added to his list of accomplishments a Honorary Doctorate of Music from the renowed Berklee College of Music.", "html": "<P>Recording both as\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0Funkadelic,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0revolutionized R&B during the \u201970s, twisting soul music into funk by adding influences from several late-\u201960s acid heroes:\u00a0Jimi Hendrix,\u00a0Frank Zappa, and\u00a0Sly Stone. The\u00a0Parliament/Funkadelicmachine ruled black music during the \u201970s, capturing over 40 R&B hit singles (including three number ones) and recording three platinum albums.</P><P>Born in Kannapolis, NC, on July 22, 1941,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0became interested in doo wop while living in New Jersey during the early \u201950s. . Basing his group on\u00a0Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, Clinton formed\u00a0The Parliaments\u00a0in 1955, rehearsing in the back room of a Plainfield barbershop where he straightened hair.\u00a0The Parliaments\u00a0released only two singles during the next ten years, but frequent trips to Detroit during the mid-\u201960s \u2013 where Clinton began working as a songwriter and producer \u2013 eventually paid off their investment.</P><P>The Parliaments\u00a0finally had a hit with the 1967 single \u201c(I Wanna) Testify\u201d for the Detroit-based\u00a0Revilot Records, but the label ran into trouble and Clinton refused to record any new material. Instead of waiting for a settlement, Clinton decided to record the same band under a new name:\u00a0Funkadelic. Founded in 1968, the group began life as a smoke screen, claiming as its only members the Parliaments\u2019 backing but in truth including Clinton and the rest of the former Parliaments lineup. Revilot folded not long after, with the label\u2019s existing contracts sold to\u00a0Atlantic; Clinton, however, decided to abandon the Parliaments name rather than record for the major label.</P><P>By 1970,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0had regained the rights to\u00a0The Parliaments\u00a0name: he then signed the entire\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0lineup to\u00a0Invictus Records\u00a0as\u00a0Parliament. The group released one album \u2013 1970\u2019s Osmium \u2013 and scored a number 30 hit, \u201cThe Breakdown,\u201d on the R&B charts in 1971. With\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0firing on all cylinders, however, Clinton decided to discontinue\u00a0Parliament\u00a0(the name, not the band) for the time being.</P><P>Inspired by\u00a0Motown\u2018s assembly line of sound,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0gradually put together a collective of over 50 musicians and recorded the ensemble during the \u201970s both as\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0Funkadelic. While\u00a0Funkadelic\u00a0pursued band-format psychedelic rock,\u00a0Parliament\u00a0engaged in a funk free-for-all, blending influences from the godfathers (James Brown\u00a0and\u00a0Sly Stone) with freaky costumes and themes inspired by \u201960s acid culture and science fiction. From its 1970 inception until Clinton\u2019s dissolving of\u00a0Parliament\u00a0in 1980, Clinton hit the R&B Top Ten several times but truly excelled in two other areas: large-selling, effective album statements and the most dazzling, extravagant live show in the business. In an era when Philly soul continued the slick sounds of establishment-approved R&B,\u00a0Parliament / Funkadelic\u00a0scared off more white listeners than it courted. (Ironically, today Clinton\u2019s audiences are a cross-cultural mix of music lovers from 8 to 80.)</P><P>1978-79 was the most successful year in\u00a0Parliament/Funkadelic\u00a0history:\u00a0Parliament\u00a0hit the charts first with \u201cFlash Light,\u201d P-Funk\u2019s first R&B number one. \u201cAqua Boogie\u201d would hit number one as well late in the year, but\u00a0Funkadelic\u2018s title track to \u201cOne Nation Under a Groove\u201d spent six weeks at the top spot on the R&B charts during the summer.

He has performed comedy for the president of the United States, at a TED conference, and in a crypt in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

In October 2007, Harper Collins published Peter's first book,\u00a0The Book of Vice: Naughty Things and How to Do Them, a series of essays about bad behavior, which was released in paperback in 2008.
